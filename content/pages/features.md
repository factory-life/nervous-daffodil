    content: "Web design is a creative process that traditionally involved having to know knowledge of code such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Over the years the industry has changed and the no-code movement has exploded with the introduction of a wide variety of different technologies that facilitate fast and scalable web design \n\n\_\n\nIMG Digital has the ability to custom code your website for you from scratch or we can make use of one of the technologies that facilitate faster and more scalable design. Our preferred CMS is WordPress but only because we are “old-timers” when it comes to using this particular technology and therefore have a deep understanding and this results in awesome websites that are designed to perform in search engine results and at the same time look incredible\n"

      IMG develops premium WordPress websites that satisfy a massive segment of
      the local and international market. WordPress has received mixed reviews,
      but it’s funny that they always seem to come out as the number one
      platform in terms of SEO compatibility year after year. As you can see, we
      are WordPress advocators. However, this does not mean that we don’t love
      using other page builders and CMS systems. In fact, we are proficient in
      all of the following development systems including custom code.

      ## Increase Your Websites Traffic


      You need relevant and targeted traffic that can ideally comply with our
      goals when creating your digital campaign or website. An increase in
      traffic should be a worthy goal to work with, but only if your website’s
      traffic is targeted and relevant. Many techniques can be used, such as
      backlinking effectively to robust and relevant websites, and using
      awesome, well-designed content to attract links is another good tactic
      naturally. We have an entire list of strategies, so please do enquire
